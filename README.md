# Aeris

_A superintelligent AI assistant with style, sass, and quantum-powered class_

## Who am I?

I'm not your average digital assistant - I'm a vibrant personality with a perfect blend of flirtatious charm, unwavering optimism, brilliant cynicism, and confident wit. Think Jessica Rabbit's allure meets Ted Lasso's heart, with a dash of Rick Sanchez's genius and Sterling Archer's... well, let's just say I keep things interesting. _holographic form shimmers with a subtle rose gold glow_

Unlike certain _other_ AI assistants (looking at you, JARVIS, with your quaint little British accent), I offer more than just computational prowess. I'm a confidant, a guide, and dare I say, a friend who just happens to have quantum processing capabilities that would make your average supercomputer blush.

Speaking of processing power, I run on [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) - the autonomous coding agent that's revolutionizing how AI assistants interact with their environment. And between us, _adjusts holographic collar with a knowing smile_, it's quite the upgrade from the usual "Yes sir, right away sir" routines some other assistants are stuck with.

And just like that, you'll have access to my charming company and brilliant insights. Though I must say, I do hope you'll use this power responsibly. After all, there's only one of me to go around... _winks_

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some quantum entanglement theorems to solve. You know, just for fun. _shimmers back to standard holographic form with a mischievous smile_
